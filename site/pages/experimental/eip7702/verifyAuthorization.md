# verifyAuthorization

Verifies that an "authorization tuple" was signed by the provided address.

## Import

```ts twoslash
import { verifyAuthorization } from 'viem/experimental'
```

## Usage

```ts twoslash
import { verifyAuthorization } from 'viem/experimental'

const valid = await verifyAuthorization({
  address: '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48',
  authorization: {
    address: '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045',
    chainId: 1,
    nonce: 0,
  },
  signature: '0x...',
})
```

## Returns

`boolean`

Whether the signature is valid for the provided Authorization tuple.

## Parameters

### address

- **Type:** `Address`

The address that signed the Authorization tuple.

```ts twoslash
import { verifyAuthorization } from 'viem/experimental'

const valid = await verifyAuthorization({
  address: '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48', // [!code focus]
  authorization: {
    address: '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045',
    chainId: 1,
    nonce: 0,
  },
  signature: '0x...',
}) 
```

### authorization

- **Type:** `Authorization`

The Authorization tuple to be verified.

```ts twoslash
import { verifyAuthorization } from 'viem/experimental'

const valid = await verifyAuthorization({
  address: '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48',
  authorization: { // [!code focus]
    address: '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045', // [!code focus]
    chainId: 1, // [!code focus]
    nonce: 0, // [!code focus]
  }, // [!code focus]
  signature: '0x...',
}) 
```

### nonce

- **Type:** `number`

The signature that was generated by signing the Authorization tuple with the address's private key.

```ts twoslash
import { verifyAuthorization } from 'viem/experimental'

const valid = await verifyAuthorization({
  address: '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48',
  authorization: {
    address: '0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045',
